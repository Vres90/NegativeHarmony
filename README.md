# NegativeHarmony

Excluding Hello Worlds and other non-interactive programs, this is my first program that I've ever programmed and it is from

This command line program inverts given musical notes over a given axis, and outputs inverted notes. The method of this is based on my own analysis of the circle of fifths.
